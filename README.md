##Description

Challenge was to refactor existing code to work with graphQL built with Apollo Server

A few challeneges I had for this assignment was understanding how mutations worked. I sturggled with understanding resolvers in conjunction with the mutations and basically how to translate everything from restful API to graphQL.

skills implemented: React, css
